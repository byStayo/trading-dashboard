# API Architecture and Data Aggregation Guide

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture and implementation guide for a centralized system to fetch and distribute market data from the Polygon.io API. The system is designed to:
- Avoid duplicate API calls by centralizing data fetching.
- Cache common data (e.g., ticker information such as Apple's stock price) for distribution to multiple widgets or modules.
- Scale efficiently from a single user to millions of users without overloading the API.
- Leverage Polygon.io API's authentication and custom headers to secure and monitor API use.

## 2. Objectives
- **Centralization:** Make a single API call per refresh cycle instead of multiple calls from each widget.
- **Caching:** Store the fetched data in a caching layer to serve all widgets with the same data.
- **Scalability:** Enable the system to handle high volume traffic by avoiding redundant external API calls.
- **Reliability:** Ensure error handling, retries, and logging to maintain system robustness.

## 3. Architectural Components
### 3.1 Centralized API Service
- A backend service responsible for making all Polygon.io API calls.
- Handles API authentication via query parameters (using the API key) and sends required custom headers (e.g., X-Polygon-Edge-ID, X-Polygon-Edge-IP-Address, X-Polygon-Edge-User-Agent).

### 3.2 Caching Layer
- Stores fetched ticker data temporarily using a cache (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache).
- Implements a TTL (Time-To-Live) mechanism to ensure data is refreshed regularly.
- Serves cached data to multiple client widgets, minimizing API call frequency.

### 3.3 Client Widget Module
- Frontend or UI components that require ticker data display (e.g., Apple's ticker data).
- Instead of each widget calling the Polygon API, widgets query the centralized service for cached data.

## 4. Workflow and Data Flow
1. **Client Request:** Widgets or pages request ticker data from the Centralized API Service.
2. **Cache Check:** The service checks the caching layer:
   - If the data is valid (fresh within the TTL), it returns the cached data.
   - If the data is missing or expired, it fetches updated data from the Polygon.io API.
3. **Fetch & Cache Update:** When needed, a single API call is made to fetch the data, which is then cached for subsequent requests.
4. **Data Distribution:** All client widgets receive the same updated ticker data from the centralized service.
5. **Repeat:** The process repeats based on a configurable refresh interval (e.g., every minute).

## 5. Detailed Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Setting Up the Centralized Service
- Develop the backend service (using Node.js/Express, Python, etc.).
- Load configuration parameters (Polygon API key, refresh interval, cache settings) from the environment or config files.

### Step 2: Configuring API Authentication
- Pass the API key as a query string parameter as per Polygon.io documentation.
- Include required headers in each API request:
  - **X-Polygon-Edge-ID:** A unique user identifier.
  - **X-Polygon-Edge-IP-Address:** The IP address of the user making the request.
  - **X-Polygon-Edge-User-Agent:** The user agent string of the client.

### Step 3: Implementing the Caching System
- Choose a caching solution (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache).
- Define unique keys for each ticker (e.g., `ticker:AAPL`).
- Set a TTL value (e.g., 60 seconds) to balance freshness and API load.
- Write functions to:
  - Check if valid cached data exists for a given ticker.
  - Fetch fresh data from Polygon.io if the cache is missing or expired.
  - Update the cache with the new data.

### Step 4: Data Fetching and Distribution
- Develop a routine (such as a cron job or setInterval) to trigger API calls at regular intervals.
- On-demand fetching: If a widget requests data and the cache is stale, trigger an immediate update.
- Use asynchronous processing to handle API calls without blocking incoming requests.

### Step 5: Error Handling and Monitoring
- Implement error capture and logging mechanisms for API failures.
- Use fallbacks such as serving the last known good data if the API call fails.
- Consider retry strategies with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- Monitor API usage to ensure compliance with rate limits and usage analytics.

## 6. Scalability Considerations
- **Load Balancing:** Ensure that the centralized service can scale horizontally to handle a large number of requests.
- **Distributed Caching:** Consider using a distributed caching solution like a Redis cluster for high availability.
- **Efficient API Usage:** By centralizing and caching API calls, even millions of users can be served without overwhelming the Polygon API.

## 7. Best Practices
- **Separation of Concerns:** Isolate API call logic, caching mechanisms, and client data serving into separate modules or services.
- **Configuration Management:** Use environment-specific configurations for API keys, refresh intervals, and cache settings.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for each module to ensure system reliability and performance.
- **Documentation:** Keep this document and code comments up-to-date with system changes.

## 8. Example Code Outline (Pseudo-code)
Below is a high-level pseudo-code outline using Node.js/Express:

/*
// Centralized API Service
async function fetchTickerData(ticker) {
  // Check cache first
  let data = cache.get(`ticker:${ticker}`);
  if (data && isValid(data)) {
    return data;
  }
  
  // Construct API URL with authentication
  const url = `https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker/${ticker}/range/1/day/2023-01-01/2023-04-14?apiKey=${process.env.POLY_API_KEY}`;

  // Define required headers
  const headers = {
    "X-Polygon-Edge-ID": generateEdgeId(),
    "X-Polygon-Edge-IP-Address": getClientIp(),
    "X-Polygon-Edge-User-Agent": getUserAgent()
  };

  // Fetch data from Polygon.io
  data = await http.get(url, { headers });

  // Update cache with TTL
  cache.set(`ticker:${ticker}`, data, ttl);
  return data;
}

// Express Route Handler
app.get('/ticker/:symbol', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const ticker = req.params.symbol;
    const data = await fetchTickerData(ticker);
    res.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to retrieve data" });
  }
});
*/

## 9. Conclusion
By centralizing the process of fetching data from Polygon.io and caching the results, the system minimizes redundant API calls and reduces latency for users. This architecture supports scalability from a few users to millions by serving shared data across all widgets efficiently, ensuring compliance with API limits and authentication protocols.
