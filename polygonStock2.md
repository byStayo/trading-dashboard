Stocks API Documentation

The Polygon.io Stocks API provides REST endpoints that let you query the latest market data from all US stock exchanges. You can also find data on company financials, stock market holidays, corporate actions, and more.
Documentation
Authentication
Pass your API key in the query string like follows:
https://api.polygon.io/v2/aggs/ticker/AAPL/range/1/day/2023-01-09/2023-01-09?apiKey=p5uw0M64vyHqG_Xp3TNcQxC0EO09Q9c5

Copy
Alternatively, you can add an Authorization header to the request with your API Key as the token in the following form:
Authorization: Bearer p5uw0M64vyHqG_Xp3TNcQxC0EO09Q9c5

Copy
Usage
Many of Polygon.io's REST endpoints allow you to extend query parameters with inequalities like date.lt=2023-01-01 (less than) and date.gte=2023-01-01 (greater than or equal to) to search ranges of values. You can also use the field name without any extension to query for exact equality. Fields that support extensions will have an "Additional filter parameters" dropdown beneath them in the docs that detail the supported extensions for that parameter.
Response Types
By default, all endpoints return a JSON response. Users with Stocks Starter plan and above can request a CSV response by including 'Accept': 'text/csv' as a request parameter.

Ticker Details v3
GET
/v3/reference/tickers/{ticker}
Get a single ticker supported by Polygon.io. This response will have detailed information about the ticker and the company behind it.
Parameters
ticker
*

The ticker symbol of the asset.

date


Specify a point in time to get information about the ticker available on that date. When retrieving information from SEC filings, we compare this date with the period of report date on the SEC filing.

For example, consider an SEC filing submitted by AAPL on 2019-07-31, with a period of report date ending on 2019-06-29. That means that the filing was submitted on 2019-07-31, but the filing was created based on information from 2019-06-29. If you were to query for AAPL details on 2019-06-29, the ticker details would include information from the SEC filing.

Defaults to the most recent available date.

Stocks WebSocket Documentation

The Polygon.io Stocks WebSocket API provides streaming access to the latest stock market data from all US stock exchanges. You can specify which channels you want to consume by sending instructions in the form of actions. Our WebSockets emit events to notify you when an event has occurred in a channel you've subscribed to.
Our WebSocket APIs are based on entitlements that control which WebSocket Clusters you can connect to and which kinds of data you can access. Examples in these docs include your API key, which only you can see, and are personalized based on your entitlements.
Step 1: Connect
Your current plan includes 1 connection to wss://delayed.polygon.io/stocks. If you attempt additional connections, the existing connection will be disconnected. If you need more simultaneous connections to this cluster, you can contact support.
Connecting to a cluster:
Delayed:wscat -c wss://delayed.polygon.io/stocks

Copy
On connection you will receive the following message:
[{
	"ev":"status",
	"status":"connected",
	"message": "Connected Successfully"
}]
Step 2: Authenticate
You must authenticate before you can make any other requests.
{"action":"auth","params":"p5uw0M64vyHqG_Xp3TNcQxC0EO09Q9c5"}

Copy
On successful authentication you will receive the following message:
[{
	"ev":"status",
	"status":"auth_success",
	"message": "authenticated"
}]
Step 3: Subscribe
Once authenticated, you can request a stream. You can request multiple streams in the same request.
{"action":"subscribe","params":"AM.LPL"}

Copy
You can also request multiple streams from the same cluster.
{"action":"subscribe","params":"AM.LPL,AM.MSFT"}

Copy
Usage
Things happen very quickly in the world of finance, which means a Polygon.io WebSocket client must be able to handle many incoming messages per second. Due to the nature of the WebSocket protocol, if a client is slow to consume messages from the server, Polygon.io's server must buffer messages and send them only as fast as the client can consume them. To help prevent the message buffer from getting too long, Polygon.io may send more than one JSON object in a single WebSocket message. We accomplish this by wrapping all messages in a JSON array, and adding more objects to the array if the message buffer is getting longer. For example, consider a WebSocket message with a single trade event in it:
[
    {"ev":"T","sym":"MSFT","i":"50578","x":4,"p":215.9721,"s":100,"t":1611082428813,"z":3}
]
If your client is consuming a bit slow, or 2+ events happened in very short succession, you may receive a single WebSocket message with more than one event inside it, like this:
[
    {"ev":"T","sym":"MSFT","i":"50578","x":4,"p":215.9721,"s":100,"t":1611082428813,"z":3}, 
    {"ev":"T","sym":"MSFT","i":"12856","x":4,"p":215.989,"s":1,"c":[37],"t":1611082428814,"z":3}
]
Note that if a client is consuming messages too slowly for too long, Polygon.io's server-side buffer may get too large. If that happens, Polygon.io will terminate the WebSocket connection. You can check your account dashboard to see if a connection was terminated as a slow consumer. If this happens to you consistently, consider subscribing to fewer symbols or channels.
